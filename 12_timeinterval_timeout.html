    <h3>Scheduling: setTimeout and setInterval</h3>
    <p> We may decide to execute a function not right now, but at a certain time later. That’s called “scheduling a
        call”.</p>
    <p> There are two methods for it:</p>
    <ul>

        <li> setTimeout allows us to run a function once after the interval of time.</li>
        <li> setInterval allows us to run a function repeatedly, starting after the interval of time, then repeating
            continuously at that interval.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        These methods are not a part of JavaScript specification. But most environments have the internal scheduler and
        provide these methods. In particular, they are supported in all browsers and Node.js.
    </p>
    <script>

        setTimeout(() => {
            console.log("called inside timeout");
        }, 5000);
        setInterval(() => {
            console.log("called inside interval");
            
        }, 2000);
    </script>
